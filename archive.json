      "body": "As discussed in [this tcpm thread](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tcpm/O7Q55oXcoI1XNBZ_wAQOMdhRQNY/), after fast convergence (section 4.6), the candidate target value of the congestion window may be less than the current congestion window. For example, say cwnd = 100, beta_cubic = .7 and a congestion event occurs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nW_max = cwnd = 100;\r\nW_max = W_max*(1.0+beta_cubic)/2.0 = 85   // further reduce W_max for fast convergence\r\n\r\ncwnd = cwnd * beta_cubic = 70\t          // window reduction\r\nW_cubic(0) = W_max * beta_cubic = 59.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to enter congestion avoidance at this point, with a small enough RTT, the candidate target congestion window as calculated by W_cubic(t+RTT) may be less than the current congestion window (~59.5 < 70). \r\n\r\nThe suggestion in the thread from Lisong Xu and Vidhi Goel is to change Equation 2 to:\r\n```\r\nK = cubic_root((W_max - cwnd)/C) (Eq. 2)\r\n```\r\nwhere cwnd is the congestion window size at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance. This will ensure the target is greater than the current congestion window, and in my opinion is a more clear representation of what K represents.",
